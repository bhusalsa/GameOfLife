<H1>Conway's Game of Life</H1>
This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton created by mathematician John Conway. 
The project was built as part of my exploration into advanced programming concepts.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This Game of Life implementation is based on the guidelines and tutorial provided in Robert Heaton's Programming Project for Advanced Beginners Series. 
While I have written most of the code myself, certain portions were adapted from Heaton's tutorial and other online resources.

A significant addition to this project was the integration of JavaFX for the graphical user interface (GUI). This was my own contribution, 
as I wanted to enhance the project's interactivity and visual appeal by incorporating JavaFX.

<h2>Current Status</h2>
The project is still a work in progress, with some features and optimizations still in development. 
The primary game logic and basic functionality are operational, but there are a few enhancements and refinements I plan to implement in future updates.
